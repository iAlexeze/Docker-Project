# Docker-Project Repository
This repository contains diagrams and sample configurations for running Docker applications, microservices, and monolithic applications. 
The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple starting point for developers who are new to Docker and want to learn how to run and manage Docker containers.

## Contents

This repository contains the following directories:

**Diagrams:** This directory contains diagrams that illustrate Docker flow, Docker applications, microservices, and monolithic applications.

**Docker Setup:** This file contains sample configurations for setting up Docker on your local machine or a remote server.

**Microservices:** This file contains sample configurations and code for running microservices in Docker containers.

**Monolithic Applications:** This file contains sample configurations and code for running monolithic applications in Docker containers.
 
**Dockerfile:** This is a simple Dockerfile for building a Docker image that runs a basic web application.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/iAlexeze/Docker-Project.git

Once you have cloned the repository, you can explore the contents of the directories and files and use them as a starting point for your own Docker projects.

To build the Docker image using the Dockerfile, follow the instructions below:

## Build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-web-app

This will create a Docker image named my-web-app based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.

## Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-app

This will start a Docker container based on the my-web-app image and map port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 in the container.

## Access the web application in your browser:

http://localhost:8080
You should see a basic web page that says "Hello, world!".
